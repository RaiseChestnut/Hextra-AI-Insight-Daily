# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we"). Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially saying "I agree!" and accepting these terms.

## 1. Our Services at a Glance
Our services offer users paid subscription content and membership perks. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up, some content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- To register an account, users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password.
- Your account security is your responsibility; you're on the hook for all activities under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account.
- We reserve the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). We don't store your payment info, keeping things secure!
- Your subscription will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: If you're a first-time subscriber and not stoked with our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're seeking a refund. Each user gets one shot at this. If it's been more than 14 days or it's not your first subscription, sorry, but **no refunds** after payment, unless the law absolutely forces our hand.

## 4. Content Usage & Our Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please, don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our authorization.
- Users only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** our content for personal learning and reading.
- If you're looking for commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to us for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- Users are **strictly prohibited** from uploading, posting, or distributing any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- It's a big **no-no** to mass download, scrape, or crack member-only content using technical means.
- We reserve the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate all or part of our services at any time, without prior notice.
- We won't be liable for compensation if content is temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided on this site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical).
- We are **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using the Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations fail, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
