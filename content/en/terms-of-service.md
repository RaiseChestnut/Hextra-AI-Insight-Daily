*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka “**the Site**” or “**we**”)! Before diving into our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you’re totally on board with these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
**The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only available to subscribers!

## 2. Your Account & Registration
- **Users** gotta provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are fully responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Deets
- **Subscription services** are billed monthly/annually, with fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- **All payments** go through third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). FYI, we don't store your payment info here.
- **Your subscription** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-Day Refund Policy**: First-time subscribers, if you're not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Each user gets one refund shot. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued unless legally required.

## 4. Content Use & IP Rights
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! No unauthorized copying, reprinting, or commercial use.
- **Users** only get a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
- **For commercial use** or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site for authorization.

## 5. User Conduct - Play Nice!
- **Don't even think about** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- **Seriously, don't** try to bulk download, scrape, or crack member-only content using tech tricks.
- **We've got the right** to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Downtime
- **We** totally reserve the right to change, suspend, or pull the plug on any or all services at any time, without prior notice. Just sayin'.
- **The Site** won't be on the hook for any compensation if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server glitches, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Our Disclaimer (Read This!)
- **The info** provided on this Site is just for kicks and reference. It **doesn't count** as any kind of professional advice (like financial, legal, medical, etc.).
- **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Just keeping it real.

## 8. Legal Stuff & Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and interpreted under the laws of California, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles.
- **Any disputes** arising from or related to these terms? We should totally try to sort it out friendly-style first. If that doesn't fly, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
