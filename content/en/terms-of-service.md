# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (which we'll call "The Site" or "we" for short). Before you dive into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By hitting up or using The Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms.

## 1. About Our Services

So, what's the deal with our services? Well, The Site provides you, our awesome users, with paid subscription content and membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, cool e-books, and lively community interactions – and tons more! Just a heads-up, some of that good stuff is exclusively for our subscribed members. 😉

## 2. User Registration & Accounts

*   **Users** gotta hook us up with a valid email address and set a password to get their account registered.
*   **You** are totally responsible for keeping your account secure and for all the activity happening under it. And listen up: **DO NOT** transfer or share your account with anyone! 🚫
*   **We** (The Site, that is) can totally **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. Just sayin'.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services

*   **Subscription services** are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets on the fees clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   **All payments** go through super secure third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal, etc.). Good news: we never store your payment info here! 🔐
*   **Your subscription** will **automatically renew** – heads up! – unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   **Our 14-day Refund Policy**: If you're a first-timer and not totally stoked about our service, you can snag a full refund within 14 days of your purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and let us know why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at a refund, capiche? After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo, **no refunds** will be given after payment, unless the law specifically says otherwise. Sorry, not sorry!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property

*   **All original content** here is **copyrighted by The Site (hubtoday)**. Hands off! You absolutely can't copy, repost, or use it for any commercial shenanigans without getting our green light first. 🙅‍♀️
*   **Users** snag a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** to our stuff, strictly for personal learning and reading. Keep it to yourself, alright?
*   **Got a commercial idea or wanna quote us a bunch?** Then you gotta hit up The Site to get the official authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines

*   **Seriously, DO NOT** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or totally infringes on anyone else's rights. Play nice! 😠
*   **And hey, DO NOT** try any tech wizardry to mass download, scrape, or crack into our member-exclusive content. That's a big no-no.
*   **We** (The Site) can totally remove any inappropriate content and will not hesitate to **ban any rule-breaking users**. Consider yourself warned!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions

*   **We** keep the right to change, pause, or totally stop any part or all of our services whenever we want, and we won't always give you a heads-up beforehand. Just how it rolls! 🤷‍♀️
*   **If** our content happens to be temporarily unreachable because of stuff like "force majeure" (fancy legal talk for things beyond our control), server hiccups, or third-party service outages, **The Site isn't on the hook for any compensation**. Bummer, we know, but it's out of our hands sometimes.

## 7. Disclaimer

*   **Just a heads-up:** The info we dish out on The Site is purely for reference. It **DOES NOT** count as any kind of professional advice (think financial, legal, medical – you get the drift). So don't take it as gospel, okay? 😉
*   **The Site** **isn't responsible** for any losses, big or small, that you might run into from using our content or services. Use your best judgment!

## 8. Governing Law

*   **These Terms of Service** are governed by and will be interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA, no matter what its conflict of law principles say.
*   **Any disputes** popping up from or related to these terms? We should totally try to hash things out nicely with friendly negotiation first. If that doesn't work, you're agreeing to take it to the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. So there!
