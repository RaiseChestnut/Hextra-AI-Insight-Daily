# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter referred to as "the Site" or "We")! 👋 Before you dive into using our services, please seriously give these Terms of Service a good read. By accessing or using our Site, you're essentially saying "Yep, I agree!" to these terms.

## 1. What We Offer
**The Site** provides users with awesome paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and lively community interaction. Just a heads-up: some content is only for our cool subscribers.

## 2. User Registration & Your Account
- **Users** must whip up an account by providing a valid email address and setting a password.
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all the shenanigans happening under it. Transferring or sharing accounts? That's a big **NOPE**.
- **The Site** reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they decide to play by their own rules and violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and don't worry, the fees are crystal clear on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed securely through third-party platforms like Stripe or PayPal. We don't store your payment info – phew!
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** like clockwork, unless you cancel 'em before your current billing cycle wraps up.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers: if you're not totally thrilled with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund.
- **To request a refund**, shoot us an email at the address listed at the end of these terms and spill the beans on why you're unhappy. Just a heads-up, each user gets only one refund shot.
- **For purchases** made after 14 days or for non-first-time subscriptions, refunds are generally **not provided** after payment, unless the law steps in and says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
- **All original content** is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial stuff without our say-so.
- **Users** only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights** – strictly for personal learning and reading, okay?
- **For commercial use** or if you wanna cite us extensively, please hit us up to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- **Users are absolutely prohibited from** uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, fake, offensive, or steps on other people's rights.
- **It's also a big no-no to** bulk download, scrape, or hack member content using technical wizardry.
- **The Site** reserves the right to zap inappropriate content and **ban violating users** faster than you can say "oops."

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to tweak, pause, or even stop parts or all of our services anytime, without giving you a heads-up. That's just how the tech world rolls!
- **The Site** **bears no liability for compensation** if content becomes temporarily unavailable due to crazy things like force majeure, server meltdowns, or third-party service hiccups.

## 7. Disclaimer
- **The information provided by the Site** is purely for reference. It **does not count as** professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff), so don't treat it as such.
- **The Site** **is not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services. Just keeping it real!

## 8. Governing Law
- **These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, USA 🇺🇸, without getting tangled up in conflict of law principles.
- **For any disputes** arising from or relating to these terms, both parties should first try to chat it out nicely. If that doesn't work, you agree to take it to the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California.
