### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Sakana AI** introduces a brutal training method where AI programs hunt each other in virtual machines. This novel approach is part of a [Research Project (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03335) in collaboration with MIT. What's really cool is the phenomenon of convergent evolution, where different programs actually evolve similar behaviors!

2.  **OpenAI** has officially thrown its weight behind Open Code, allowing direct authorization via ChatGPT. This means Plus and Pro users can now confidently use [Open Code (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/2010031968399028555) without fretting over account bans. Go ahead and call that Codex model to your heart's content!

### Frontier Research

1.  **The Digital Red Queen** makes its grand entrance! Sakana dropped a super hardcore DRQ algorithm that forces AI programs to constantly evolve in Core War. What's wild is that it led to **convergent evolution**, where different experiments ultimately developed [Similar Strategies (AI News)](https://sakana.ai/drq/). Oh, and the code is already open source, btw!

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Tsinghua University** played host to a powerhouse gathering of AI bigwigs, bringing together the "Four Grandmasters of Foundation Models" in Zhongguancun. The info density was absolutely wild! Tang Jie declared the Chat era pretty much over, while Yang Zhilin emphasized that building models is all about crafting a **worldview**. Lin Junyang even gave China a 20% chance of overtaking. This [Full Report (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/01/368917.html) is definitely worth a deep dive.

2.  **DeepSeek**, a global top-tier product, actually started out as a side project! Just like how Fang Quan Quantitative's side hustle became a worldwide sensation. Qwen kicked off as a side project too, and guess what? Claude Code followed suit. A [Qubit Report (AI News)](https://www.qbitai.com/2026/01/368958.html) explored eight such cases. Makes you wonder, do side projects actually have a higher chance of striking gold?

3.  **Caution is needed against an anti-AI bubble**, as open-source licensing disputes continue to heat up. The big question: Can GPL actually constrain model-generated content? Tailwind was even snagged as a case study for discussion. With code quality seemingly dropping and job anxiety spreading, this [Detailed Discussion (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46574276) offers a pretty diverse set of viewpoints. Let's get pragmatic with experiments and not just blindly reject new tech! <br/>
