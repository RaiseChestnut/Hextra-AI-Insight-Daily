### Security of Your Personal Data
The security of Your Personal Data is a big deal to us! But hey, remember, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% foolproof. While we try our best to use commercially acceptable ways to shield Your Personal Data, we can't pinky promise its absolute security. 🤷‍♀️

## Children's Privacy
Our Service does not target anyone under the age of 13. We don't knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you know your kiddo has given us Personal Data, please hit us up. If we find out we've collected Personal Data from anyone under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we'll take steps to ditch that info from our servers.

If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your info, and your country requires consent from a parent, we might ask for your parent's consent before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might contain links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to that third party's site. We totally recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit.

We have zero control over, and take zero responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. Just sayin'!
