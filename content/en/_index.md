2.  **Nvidia has acquired SchedMD, the developer of Slurm.** This low-key move is being hailed as "widening their moat" 💪. Slurm, developed by SchedMD, is the resource scheduling tool used by over half of the world's TOP500 supercomputers, with giants like Meta, Mistral, and Thinking Machines relying on it. Even if you're rocking AMD chips, if you need computing power scheduling, you simply [can't bypass Nvidia (AI News)](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-acquires-schedmd/).

3.  **AI context management is sparking privacy debates.** Would you trust uploading all your life notes to a third-party server? Community discussions show that while 🔥 feeding Obsidian notes to Claude can net you personalized advice, most folks are leaning towards [controllable solutions (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46299552) like local LLMs. Others are even warning that relying too much on AI summaries might erode true knowledge acquisition.

4.  **GitHub Actions is starting to charge platform fees!** Starting in 2026, scheduling for private repositories and self-hosted runners will be billed at $0.002 per minute 💸. Yep, even if your computing power is on your own servers, you'll be paying a "tax." Smaller teams are feeling the pinch more, and the community is already weighing up alternative solutions like GitLab or [Forgejo (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46291500).

5.  **Can AI push formal verification into the mainstream?** The hot topic here is that specifications themselves are tough to formalize, and requirements are always shifting. Optimists point out that big models like Opus and GPT-5.2 🤖 have significantly sped up proof engineering. But the pessimists reckon cultural and economic barriers are the [true obstacles to popularization (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46294574).

### Top Open Source Projects
